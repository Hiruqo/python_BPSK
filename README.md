BPSK modulation/demodulation of 2 users signal (common transmission canal)

BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying) is a form of digital modulation in which information is transmitted by changing the phase of a carrier signal. This signal can take on one of two phases, corresponding to two bit states (0 or 1).

In the context of NOMA in BPSK modulation, this technology can be used to transmit data from different users simultaneously on the same frequency and at the same time. NOMA allows different users to use the same spectral resource, while assigning different signal strengths to each user.
